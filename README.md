# Central Limit Theorem Demonstration via Coin Toss

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) through a simulated experiment involving coin tosses. The project conducts 1000 experiments, each with 100 coin tosses, and analyzes the distribution of sample means.

## Key Features

- **Simulation of Coin Tosses**: Conducts 1000 experiments, each involving 100 coin tosses, to generate a distribution of sample means.
  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Compares empirical values of the mean and Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) with theoretical values for a fair coin.

- **Data Visualization**: Includes histograms and gaussian distributions to visualize the distribution of sample means and their evolution over multiple experiments.

- **CLT Validation**: Empirically validates the Central Limit Theorem by comparing the sample distribution with a theoretical normal distribution.

The project serves as an educational tool for understanding the Central Limit Theorem and its practical applications in statistics.
